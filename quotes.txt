To be or not to be: that is the question
Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I â€“ I took the road less traveled by
If I should die, think only this of me
Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness
I wandered lonely as a cloud
